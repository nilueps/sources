Socially determined truth criteria

"Sources" is a tool to help determine the _truth-value_ or _trustworthiness_ of claims according to _socially determined truth criteria_ making up what I call _truth paradigms_.

Truth criteria are what allow us to judge the truth value of claims within the context of a particular truth paradigm. For example, in the scientific truth paradigm, evidence-based truth criteria will determine the truth-value of claims according to the quantity and quality of supporting evidence. In the religious truth paradigm, faith-based truth criteria will determine the truth-value of claims based on axiomatic statements.

Determining what is true is a social process. "Sources" aims to provide a platform on which users can propose and discuss the truth criteria that make up _truth paradigms_ and then go on to use those criteria to engage in community decisions as to the truth-value of claims in all branches of knowledge.

"Sources" is a work-in-progress hobby project with no planned release date
